            <ul>
                <li><strong>1958–1975</strong> - Early life and the Jackson 5</li>
                <p>Michael Joseph Jackson was born in Gary, Indiana, near Chicago, on August 29, 1958. He was the eighth of ten children in the Jackson family, a working-class African-American family living in a two-bedroom house on Jackson Street.</p>
                <li><strong>1975–1981</strong> - Move to Epic and Off the Wall</li>
                <p>In 1975, the Jackson 5 left Motown. They signed with Epic Records, a subsidiary of CBS Records,[47] and renamed themselves the Jacksons. Their younger brother Randy joined the band around this time</p>
                <li><strong>1982–1983</strong> - Thriller and Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever</li>
                <p>Jackson recorded with Queen singer Freddie Mercury from 1981 to 1983, recording demos of "State of Shock", "Victory" and "There Must Be More to Life Than This"</p>
                <li><strong>1984–1985</strong> - Pepsi, "We Are the World", and business career</li>
                <p>In November 1983, Jackson and his brothers partnered with PepsiCo in a $5 million promotional deal that broke records for a celebrity endorsement.</p>
                <li><strong>1986–1987</strong> - Changing appearance, tabloids, and films</li>
                <p>Jackson's skin had been medium-brown during his youth, but from the mid-1980s gradually grew paler. The change drew widespread media coverage, including speculation that he had been bleaching his skin.</p>
                <li><strong>1987–1990</strong> - Bad, autobiography, and Neverland</li>
                <p>Jackson's first album in five years, Bad (1987), was highly anticipated, with the industry expecting another major success.[129] It became the first album to produce five US number-one singles: "I Just Can't Stop Loving You", "Bad", "The Way You Make Me Feel", "Man in the Mirror", and "Dirty Diana"</p>
                <li><strong>1991–1993</strong> - Dangerous, Heal the World Foundation, and Super Bowl XXVII halftime show</li>
                <p>In March 1991, Jackson renewed his contract with Sony for $65 million, a record-breaking deal,[155] beating Neil Diamond's renewal contract with Columbia Records.</p>
                <li><strong>1993–1995</strong> - First child sexual abuse accusations and first marriage</li>
                <p>In August 1993, Jackson was accused of child sexual abuse by a 13-year-old boy, Jordan Chandler, and his father, Evan Chandler.[177] Jordan said he and Jackson had engaged in acts of kissing, masturbation and oral sex.</p>
                <li><strong>1995–1997</strong> - HIStory, second marriage, and fatherhood</li>
                <p>The first single from HIStory was "Scream/Childhood". "Scream", a duet with Jackson's youngest sister Janet, protests the media's treatment of Jackson during the 1993 child abuse allegations against him.</p>
                <li><strong>1997–2002</strong> - Label dispute and Invincible</li>
                <p>From October 1997 to September 2001, Jackson worked on his tenth solo album, Invincible, which cost $30 million to record. In June 1999, Jackson joined Luciano Pavarotti for a War Child benefit concert in Modena, Italy.</p>
                <li><strong>2002–2005</strong> - Second child sexual abuse allegations, trial, and acquittal</li>
                <p>On December 18, 2003, Santa Barbara authorities charged Jackson with seven counts of child molestation and two counts of intoxicating a minor with alcoholic drinks.</p>
